\title{Remove/Replace/Extract Strings Between 2 Markers}
\usage{
rm_between(text.var, left, right, trim = TRUE, clean = TRUE,
  replacement = "", extract = FALSE, include.markers = ifelse(extract,
  FALSE, TRUE), dictionary = getOption("regex.library"), ...)

rm_between_multiple(text.var, left, right, trim = TRUE, clean = TRUE,
  replacement = "", extract = FALSE, include.markers = FALSE,
  merge = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{text.var}{The text variable.}

\item{left}{A vector of character or numeric symbols as the left edge to
extract.}

\item{right}{A vector of character or numeric symbols as the right edge to
extract.}

\item{trim}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} removes leading and trailing white
spaces.}

\item{clean}{trim logical.  If \code{TRUE} extra white spaces and escaped
character will be removed.}

\item{replacement}{Replacement for matched \code{pattern}.}

\item{extract}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} the strings are extracted into a
list of vectors.}

\item{include.markers}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} and \code{extract = TRUE} returns
the markers (left/right) and the text between.}

\item{dictionary}{A dictionary of canned regular expressions to search within
if \code{pattern} begins with \code{"@rm_"}.}

\item{merge}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} the results of each bracket type will
be merged by string.  \code{FALSE} returns a named list of lists of vectors
of markered text per marker type.}

\item{\dots}{Other arguments passed to \code{\link[base]{gsub}}.}
}
\value{
Returns a character string with markers removed.  If
\code{rm_between} returns merged strings and is significantly faster.  If
\code{rm_between_multiple} the strings are optionally merged by
\code{left}/\code{right} symbols.  The latter approach is more flexible and
names extracted strings by symbol boundaries, however, it is slower than
\code{rm_between}.

\description{
Remove/replace/extract strings bounded between a left and right marker.

\examples{
x <-  "I like [bots] (not)."

rm_between(x, "(", ")")
rm_between(x, "(", ")", extract=TRUE)

rm_between(x, c("(", "["), c(")", "]"), include.markers=FALSE)
rm_between(x, c("(", "["), c(")", "]"), extract=TRUE, include.markers=TRUE)

## multiple (naming and ability to keep separate bracket types but slower)
