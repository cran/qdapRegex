Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

qdapRegex 0.1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

First CRAN Release

NEW FEATURES

* `rm_citation` added for removing/extracting/replacing APA 6 style in-text 
  citations.

* `rm_white` and accompanying family of `rm_white` functions added to remove 
  white space.

* `rm_non_ascii` added to remove non-ASCII characters from a string.

* `around_` added to extract word(s) around a given point.

* `pages` and `pages2` added to the `regex_supplement` data set for 
  removing/extracting/validating page numbers.

IMPROVEMENTS

* `rm_XXX` family of functions now use `stringi::stri_extract_all_regex` as this 
  approach is much faster than the 
  `regmatches(text.var, gregexpr(pattern, text.var, perl = TRUE))` approach.
